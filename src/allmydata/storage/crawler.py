class ShareCrawler(HookMixin, service.MultiService):
    """
    An instance of a subclass of ShareCrawler is attached to a storage
    backend, and periodically walks the backend's shares, processing them
    in some fashion. This crawl is rate-limited to reduce the I/O burden on
    the host, since large servers can easily have a terabyte of shares in
    several million files, which can take hours or days to read.

    Once the crawler starts a cycle, it will proceed at a rate limited by the
    allowed_cpu_proportion= and cpu_slice= parameters: yielding the reactor
    after it has worked for 'cpu_slice' seconds, and not resuming right away,
    always trying to use less than 'allowed_cpu_proportion'.

    Once the crawler finishes a cycle, it will put off starting the next one
    long enough to ensure that 'minimum_cycle_time' elapses between the start
    of two consecutive cycles.

    We assume that the normal upload/download/DYHB traffic of a Tahoe-LAFS
    grid will cause the prefixdir contents to be mostly cached in the kernel,
    or that the number of sharesets in each prefixdir will be small enough to
    load quickly. A 1TB allmydata.com server was measured to have 2.56 million
    sharesets, spread into the 1024 prefixes, with about 2500 sharesets per
    prefix. On this server, each prefix took 130ms-200ms to list the first
    time, and 17ms to list the second time.

    To implement a crawler, create a subclass that implements the
    process_prefix() method. This method may be asynchronous. It will be
    called with a string prefix. Any keys that it adds to self.state will be
    preserved. Override add_initial_state() to set up initial state keys.
    Override finished_cycle() to perform additional processing when the cycle
    is complete. Any status that the crawler produces should be put in the
    self.state dictionary. Status renderers (like a web page describing the
    accomplishments of your crawler) will use crawler.get_state() to retrieve
    this dictionary; they can present the contents as they see fit.

    Then create an instance, with a reference to a backend object providing
    the IStorageBackend interface, and a filename where it can store
    persistent state. The statefile is used to keep track of how far around
    the ring the process has travelled, as well as timing history to allow
    the pace to be predicted and controlled. The statefile will be updated
    and written to disk after each time slice (just before the crawler yields
    to the reactor), and also after each cycle is finished, and also when
    stopService() is called. Note that this means that a crawler that is
    interrupted with SIGKILL while it is in the middle of a time slice will
    lose progress: the next time the node is started, the crawler will repeat
    some unknown amount of work.

    The crawler instance must be started with startService() before it will
    do any work. To make it stop doing work, call stopService(). A crawler
    is usually a child service of a StorageServer, although it should not
    depend on that.

    For historical reasons, some dictionary key names use the term "bucket"
    for what is now preferably called a "shareset" (the set of shares that a
    server holds under a given storage index).

    Subclasses should measure time using self.clock.seconds(), rather than
    time.time(), in order to make themselves deterministically testable.
